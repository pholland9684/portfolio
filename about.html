        <!-- <h3> Welcome to my about me</h3> -->



        <p>
            I am a mom of two boys. One is 16 years and the other is 13 years old. I love to read books,
            watch movies with my kids, workout and do anything that is active outdoors. I have a Silver lab
            named Bella who is 6 years old.
        </p>

            My 13 year old loves sharks and wanted to learn to scuba dive. He and I both got certified in April of
            2023.

            I went to school and got a associate degree as well as a dental
            assistiant certificate. I worked as a dental assistiant untill my first son was born. Since then I have
            been a stay at home mom for 16 years with the exception of a 6 month internship at Doterra from
            May 8, 2023- November 8, 2023. At Doterra I worked in the Qualitly Control Stability. I was able to learn
            more
            about how they test for stability at differant conditions. I was able to test some of there product and have
            a hands on experience. I also was able to learn how the record all the testings that they do in there
            program called LIMS. These are just a few of the things that I did as an intern.

        </p>
        <p>
            Both my kids do school online and because of that it is hard for
            for me to leave them home and go to work. Thats why I am hoping to be able to work from home.
            I am hoping get into the tecnology field so that I can get a good paying career so that I can provide
            a stable and happy life for me and my boys.

        </p>
